# Huffman_Coding_Tool
 A lossless file compression and decompression tool implemented using the Huffman coding algorithm. This project employs a binary tree-based encoding system to efficiently compress large datasets, reducing storage requirements while maintaining data integrity. It features modular encoding and decoding processes.
