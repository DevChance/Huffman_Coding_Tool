# Huffman Coding Tool  
A lossless file compression and decompression tool built using the **Huffman coding algorithm**. This tool efficiently compresses large datasets while preserving data integrity, making it ideal for optimizing storage and transmission.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

**Why This Stands Out:**  
This C++ implementation of Huffman coding applies **binary tree-based encoding** to achieve efficient lossless compression. It features modular encoding and decoding processes with optimized bit-level storage.

- **Compression Efficiency**: Reduces file size significantly without data loss.
- **Tree-Based Encoding**: Utilizes frequency-based **binary trees** to generate optimal prefix codes.
- **Modular Design**: Supports scalable integration with other data processing systems.

## üåü Key Features

1. **Huffman Encoding**
   - Constructs an **optimal binary tree** based on character frequency.
   - Generates **prefix-free binary codes** for lossless compression.

2. **Huffman Decoding**
   - Efficiently reconstructs original data using the Huffman tree.

3. **Bit-Level Compression**
   - Stores compressed data in **binary format** to maximize space efficiency.

4. **File I/O Support**
   - Reads from and writes to files for **seamless data compression**.

## üñ•Ô∏è **How It Works**
1. **Reads the input file** and calculates character frequencies.
2. **Constructs a Huffman tree** based on frequency distribution.
3. **Generates binary codes** for each character.
4. **Encodes the file** using the Huffman codes.
5. **Saves compressed data** in an output file.
6. **Decodes the compressed file** back to its original form.
